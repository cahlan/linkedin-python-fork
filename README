This is a fork of the python-linkedin repo found here: http://code.google.com/p/python-linkedin/

This repo did not include API for network updates found in LinkedIn REST API, and time was of the essence--so I added it in.

This repo may be suddenly outdated and no longer supported if the original Google code repo is updated.
